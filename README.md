# Node.js To-Do List Application

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **EJS Templates:** Server-side rendering of HTML using EJS templates.
- **Bootstrap Styling:** Responsive design with Bootstrap framework.
- **In-memory Data:** Example usage with in-memory data storage (no database used).

## Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-node-express.git
   cd todo-list-node-express
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running at `http://localhost:3000`.
